# Thread Talk App

## Description

This project is the front-end counterpart to my back-end project during my time in the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp.

You can find the API [**here**](https://thread-talk.onrender.com/api) and the GitHub repo [**here**](https://github.com/AnaBrh/Thread-Talk-API).

This app is intended to simulate a service similar to Reddit. It has basic functionality such as the user being able to navigate between pages, browse articles, as well as vote and post/delete comments on articles.

Currently there is a hard-coded list of users to login as that are provided in the API, making it possible to post comments and delete your own comments as that user.
This leaves space for extra functionality to be added, such as a user authentication page, posting/deleting articles etc.

You can find the hosted version of the app [here](https://thread-talk-app.netlify.app/).
